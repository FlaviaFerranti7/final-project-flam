# ESCAPE ROOM

It is an autumn evening of the 2000s, a peaceful evening on the Lazio coast. You are a private investigator and, after a normal day of work, you go to an appointment with one of your clients, Mr. X. You have important news for him. You meet him at 9.00 pm in his beach house. It's a trap!

To move in the game you have to use the mouse to look around and W A S D to go forward, left, back and right respectively. 

You only have 30 minutes to get out of here.

Have fun:

However, in order to perform a better game experience, we recommend to download the repository and try it locally with an http server using Linux.


## Project Details
The game was realized using Three.js and was created for the course of Interactive Graphics of Sapienza University.

A  very detailed description of the project has been produced [here](Escape_Room.pdf)
