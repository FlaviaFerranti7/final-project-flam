                You are a private investigator, for some time now you have been working for Mr. X. <br />
                You have finally completed your work, providing him with the information for which he hired you.
                <br />
                But your ideas are now divergent. And he understood it! <br />
                So now you're trapped in an old house where he used to spend the holidays and you have to run away.
                <br />
                You don't have much time anymore: you have to escape now! <br />
                Something bad will happen soon: only if you are able to get out in the next 30 minutes, can you
                prevent
                it...<br />
                Let's start!

            You know important details of his life: made up your mind! </br> It wasn't always a bad person. In
            1974, he
            married a young woman with whom he was madly in love and </br> from this love, 6 years later, a beautiful
            baby girl was
            born. </br> Their lives changed when his wife died in a car accident: the little girl was only 3 years old.
            </br> Then he lost the light of reason… </br>

            You're in the last room. </br>
            Don't forget why you got stuck here. After much research, </br> you discovered the identity of the man who
            caused the accident
            in which Mr. X lost the love of his life. </br> That man wants revenge: that's why he asked for your help.
            </br> You have to reach
            it in time, you have to stop it!! </br>
            Good luck! </br>

            Don't lose focus. Keep calm. You have two escape routes, but which one will allow you to reach the exit more
            easily? </br>
            Look around, you're almost there! Choose the right object that will help you. </br>

            It is a classic to keep a photo you're attached to in a book: it's so beautiful, it's from their wedding.
            But
            why reduce it to this state? </br> United, but separated. What will it mean? When they unite themselves,
            they separate…
            Maybe from time? Or not?
